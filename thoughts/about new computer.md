> A new computation mechanism based on new physical architectures

With rapid developments of physical hardware, the next-generation of computational devices would be an inevitable future but full of  mystery due to the undetermined technological routine  and fertile computable physical platforms. But some points without any doubt are that the quantum mechanism will be an definitely leading role accompanying with classical models for devices and these devices will be smaller than current cases, which may beyond our imaginations before. The unbelievable events that would make brain storms for any imaginative fiction novelist are happening and emerging every day. The content of this thought will show some of my opinions about the future computer.

1. #### Full Quantum inside

   Surely, Quantum everywhere. But it will be strongly obvious for nanoscale or smaller structures. 

   $i \partial_t \psi = \mathcal{H} \psi$

   

2. #### Multiphysics coupling

   Modern quantum mechanism usually involves in many distinguished physical processes. 

3. #### New computer infrastructures and quantum approaches

   Conventional classical computer is composed of four main parts: (1) Processors, which is functional for calculating and scheduling; (2) RAM, the devices to supply the space to process data temporarily; (3) Hard disk, storing the data for a long period; (4) Controller, 

4. #### Quantum programming languages or scripts

5. #### Quantum learning: more powerful or faster?

6. #### Link with classical devices




To be summarized, the
